The current Xephyr patch is not usable and is disabled:
 * It is *completely* insecure - anyone can connect to the Xephyr 
   server.
 * The greeter always selects the US keyboard by default.
 * It proposes to reboot/shutdown instead of having an exit button.
 * Closing the Xnest window doesnâ€™t clean it up in the GDM internal 
   status.
