  * New Portuguese translation by Pedro Ribeiro. Closes: #581250.

gdm3 (2.30.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Pass -novtswitch to the X server options, so that it doesn’t switch 
    back to the original tty when being killed. This fixes a corner case 
    of user switching which is the original upstream reason for 
    introducing the broken behavior we fixed with 
    18_switch_kill_greeter.patch.
  * 19_configure_xserver.patch: patch by Hans Petter Jansson to allow to 
    set the local X server options in the configuration file.
    Also make it use the default options the configure script sets.
  * 20_endsession_respawn.patch: new patch. Respawn transient displays 
    when the user session is finished. In combination with 
    -novtswitch, it allows a unified interface where exiting a session 
    will always bring back to a login manager, without leaving unused 
    displays either.
  * 08_frequent-users_greeter.patch: updated with an improved logic, to 
    not use the same session type for the login window and the user 
    session.
  * 21_schemas_usr.patch: new patch. Move gdm.schemas to /usr, it should 
    certainly not be editable.
  * 90_relibtoolize.patch: refreshed accordingly.
  * 22_noconsole.patch: patch from Patrick Monnerat to allow GDM to work 
    as a standalone XDMCP server.
  * 23_autologin_once.patch: patch from Vincent Untz. Do not autologin 
    again after the session has been closed. Closes: #578736.
  * gdm3.preinst: remove the old gdm.schemas upon upgrade.
